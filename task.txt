Task: Go to the website [URL], a personal website. Systematically explore all accessible content, including menus, links, embedded media, interactive elements, and downloadable materials for WEBSITE BUGS. You should prioritize areas that are often more likely to contain issues. At each stage, critically evaluate whether the displayed information, layout, and behavior align with expectations for a functional and professional web experience. Carefully inspect for issues such as, but not limited to: (1) Broken elements: dead/missing links, 404 pages, failed image or video loads. (2) Interaction failures: non-responsive buttons, malfunctioning forms or filters, non-working download or redirect actions.(3) UI/UX flaws: lack of visual feedback, missing tooltips/ESC buttons, layout inconsistencies, uncustomized templates, poor mobile compatibility. (4) Content inconsistencies: outdated or contradictory data (e.g., dates or names), mismatched references or external links, typos or formatting errors. (5) Domain-specific bugs: for instance, broken external links to publications, projects, GitHub, Google Scholar, etc. Incorrect anchor links (e.g., internal navigation like #about or #projects not working). Outdated or dead email links (e.g., mailto: pointing to deprecated addresses). Missing or malformed citation info (e.g., BibTeX files, DOI links not rendering or downloading properly). Mismatched thumbnails or missing alt-text on research project previews. Videos or talks not embedded properly (e.g., iframe blocked by CORS). For each identified issue, consider its impact, repeatability, and specific trigger (e.g., ”clicking X under condition Y leads to error Z”)
